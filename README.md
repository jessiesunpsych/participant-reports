# participant-reports

Purpose: One way to compensate research participants is to offer them feedback based on the questionnaires they completed for your study. Whether it's information about their personality or wellbeing (or anything else you're researching), people find it interesting to learn more about themselves and how they compare to others. However, generating these reports manually (e.g., using a Word template) can be time-consuming. These R scripts work with LaTeX to pump out personalised PDF reports for several participants at once. Using the example of a PERMA Wellbeing report, these scripts can be easily modified to suit your data and needs.
